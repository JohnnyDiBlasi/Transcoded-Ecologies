Transcoded Ecologies is a hybrid biological-technological installation featuring a bio-driven AI agent that emits various light wave frequencies for a tree sapling ecology while generating soundwave synthesizers frequencies along with a data visualization composition in real-time. The work creates an immersive experience where chemical and physical biproducts of an array of White oak (Quercus alba) tree saplings is measured and assisted by a machine/AI agent that has a model of what it believes is the optimum environmental state. The species of tree is relevant as these is a species commonly found in the forests of Iowa. Most forests in Iowa are made up of oak and hickory trees, and white oak is among one of the more prevalent species of tree indigenous to Iowa [1]. The use of this species of tree for the artwork gives the piece a site-specificity and links the work to the forest ecosystems in which the artwork is created and viewed.
